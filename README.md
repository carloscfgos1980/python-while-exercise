We are preparing a fun family night with a quiz. The youngest kid in the family is currently a massive fan of koalas, so we compiled a list of koala facts and wrote a function random_koala_fact that you can use in main.py.

Write the following functions by making use of while and random_koala_fact:

unique_koala_facts: takes an integer as an argument and returns that number of unique koala facts in a list. Note that there are only a limited number of unique facts in the dataset. For high arguments your function should try to return all unique facts in the dataset. No worries: the number of facts is small enough that this should be feasible. You can set an iteration limit of 1000.
num_joey_facts: young marsupials are called 'joeys'. How many unique facts mentioning this term are in our facts dataset? Count them by getting facts from random_koala_fact until you have seen some particular fact 10 times, then return how many unique joey facts you counted in the dataset.
koala_weight: somewhere in the data is a fact about how heavy a koala is. This function should return that weight in kilogram (kg) as an integer.
